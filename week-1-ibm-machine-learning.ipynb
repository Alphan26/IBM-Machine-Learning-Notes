You can find groupings inside your dataset. </p>\n\n<p> If we think about the images, each pixel can be considered as a feature. But if we think about each pixel there will be large data. Also we can't make relationships with those pixels between each other. That's why we need something else. This is where Deep Learning comes into play. Deep learning can learn these relationships on its own and more suitable for image classification </p>\n\n<p> Deep learning is the cutting edge (latest technology) in larger datasets.  </p>\n\n<p> If you don't have a stable dataset i.e your data is changing much, ML algorithms will perform better. </p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2> Modern AI </h2>\n\n<p> We have self-driving cars, also we can diagnose diseases using Computer Vision.
